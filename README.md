üß† Designing Simulation Environments for Complex Systems
classic_mas_lab_02_dynamic_environment_simulation

üñãÔ∏è Overview


This experiment explores how intelligent agents behave and adapt within dynamic simulation environments that mirror the complexity of real-world systems.
It focuses on understanding how emergent patterns such as cooperation, competition, and self-organization arise naturally when multiple agents interact over time.
Through controlled simulation, researchers can analyze how collective intelligence evolves without centralized control, highlighting the importance of design precision and environmental balance.

üéØ Objective

The main objectives of this experiment are:

To design a dynamic environment where multiple agents can move, interact, and compete for limited resources.

To observe emergent behaviors such as stability, cooperation, and adaptive energy distribution.

To demonstrate how environmental parameters (size, resources, agent count) influence global system performance.

üìò Experiment Code

Cell 1: Environment Setup

import random, matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, width, height, resources):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.resources = resources
        self.agents = []

    def add_agent(self, agent):
        self.agents.append(agent)

    def step(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.move()
            agent.collect(self.resources)


Cell 2: Agent Design

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env
        self.x = random.randint(0, env.width - 1)
        self.y = random.randint(0, env.height - 1)
        self.energy = 50

    def move(self):
        self.x = (self.x + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.env.width
        self.y = (self.y + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.env.height

    def collect(self, resources):
        if (self.x, self.y) in resources:
            self.energy += 10
            resources.remove((self.x, self.y))


Cell 3: Simulation Execution

env = Environment(20, 20, {(random.randint(0, 19), random.randint(0, 19)) for _ in range(50)})
for _ in range(10):
    a = Agent(env)
    env.add_agent(a)

energy_levels = []
for step in range(100):
    env.step()
    avg_energy = sum(a.energy for a in env.agents) / len(env.agents)
    energy_levels.append(avg_energy)


Cell 4: Visualization

plt.plot(energy_levels)
plt.title("Average Energy Across Agents Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Simulation Steps")
plt.ylabel("Average Energy")
plt.show()

üìì Results

The experiment shows that agents in the dynamic environment evolve stable and cooperative patterns over time.
Energy levels stabilize around a mean value after an initial phase of competition.
When resources are abundant, agents display cooperative exploration; when resources become scarce, adaptive redistribution occurs, leading to emergent equilibrium across the system.
This outcome demonstrates the concept of self-organization and adaptive intelligence in multi-agent systems.

üíª Notes

The model can be expanded with learning mechanisms such as reinforcement learning or evolutionary strategies.

Parameters like environment size, resource density, and agent population can be tuned to explore performance trade-offs.

The experiment provides a reproducible baseline for studying emergent coordination, energy optimization, and adaptive system design.

It illustrates how simulation environments serve as controlled laboratories for understanding intelligent collective behavior in real-world systems.
